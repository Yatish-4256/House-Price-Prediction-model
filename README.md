# **House Price Prediction Model**  
**A Machine Learning Model for Predicting Residential Property Prices**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key features such as area, number of bedrooms, and location. The model is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts including data preprocessing, regression modeling, and model evaluation.  

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Model Architecture**  
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous house prices using numerical features.  
- **Logistic Regression (Optional)**: Classifies houses as "Expensive" or "Affordable" based on a price threshold.  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Handles Categorical Data**: Uses one-hot encoding for location-based features.  
- **Train-Test Split**: Evaluates model performance on unseen data.  

### **3. Model Persistence**  
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Trained models can be stored and reused without retraining.  

### **4. Supported Features**  
- **Numerical Inputs**: Area (sq. ft.), number of bedrooms.  
- **Categorical Inputs**: Location (converted to numerical form).
